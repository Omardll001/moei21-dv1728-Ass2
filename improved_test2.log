Looks good, you got a IPv4 Socket
PID = 244432 ??
Checking server.log
udpserver running on localhost:5352 sockets=2
Check that server started, SRV_PID = 244434
244434 .
Running automatic testing, it will send requests and collect the response.
The test runs in the background, and we just 'wait' for it to complete. 
If it does not, we abort.
We will run 100 tests with a  of a client dropping a message, max 60s. Your server needs to fast enough to handle 100/60 customers/s
